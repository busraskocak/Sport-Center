Sport Center
General Information

This project is a responsive website.
It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It's a web application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI).
Buttons are fully functional.
The navbar remains visible on the page at all times during navigation.
Navbar links are linked to relevant sections via their "id".
BMI calculation is performed based on user input for weight and height. As weight and height inputs change, the position of a triangle dynamically updates.
The "Google Map" is not a static image but an interactive map.
